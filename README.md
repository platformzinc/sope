These programs are useful for drawing lines and shapes on a canvas.
For example:

If you want to drawing an expanding rectangle or triangle or polygon or other shape.

You can rotate shapes too.

These coordinate programs were developed for civil engineering surveying.

Programs include:

Polar, 
Rectangular, 
Grid Transformations, 
Lines(find distance square to a random line),

and a few others.


The x and y axis are typical for maths, but when using for displays in computing the axis are different.
It still works but you have to change the values around.



TODO:
It might be useful to have some spiral programs or any other type of programs related to civil engineering.
